# TY-PBL-Project-
In this project we have collected data of all episodes of the TV show Shark Tank India Season 1 and analyzed it by plotting graphs using the R programming language.
We have drawn the conclusions from above the plotted graph and designed a simple front end with a login page for anyone to login and view the analysis.
This analysis will be very useful for the emerging and aspiring entrepreneurs and investors
